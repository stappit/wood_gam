## Exercise 1

First we calculate the average speed manually to verify the results of the subsequent linear models.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(
  length = c(1, 3, 4, 5), 
  hours  = c(1, 4, 5, 6)
)

df1 %>% summarise(mean_speed = mean(length / hours))
```

This can also be calculated by regressing speed on a constant.

```{r}
summary(lm(length / hours ~ 1, data = df1))$coefficients
```

Interestingly, although `speed = length / hours`, regressing length on hours does not give the same result as above.

```{r}
summary(lm(length ~ 0 + hours, data = df1))$coefficients
```

## Exercise 2

The linear model $y_i = \beta + \epsilon_i$ does not depend on the $x_i$, so $\beta = \bar y$.
